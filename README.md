Kafka-Based Solution for Event Recovery & Recalculation
In an event-driven system, real-time messages are continuously streamed onto an event bus and processed by worker services. However, issues such as system failures, incorrect logic, or out-of-order events can cause some messages to be missed or processed incorrectly.Since we are not relying on a traditional database, we need a robust way to recover and back-calculate the missing or incorrect data while ensuring accuracy and consistency.
