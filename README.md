**Kafka-Based Solution for Event Recovery & Recalculation**<br>
In an event-driven system, real-time messages are continuously streamed onto an event bus and processed by worker services. However, issues such as system failures, incorrect logic, or out-of-order events can cause some messages to be missed or processed incorrectly.Since we are not relying on a traditional database, we need a robust way to recover and back-calculate the missing or incorrect data while ensuring accuracy and consistency.<br>

**Approach to Solving This Problem**<br>
To address these challenges, we use **Apache Kafka** because it provides: <br>
**Event Replay** – Ability to replay past messages, allowing us to recover lost data.<br>
**Parallel Processing** – Consumer groups distribute workloads efficiently.<br>
**High Throughput** – Can handle millions of events per second.<br>
**Low Latency (~1ms Processing Time)** – Ideal for real-time event-driven systems.<br>

**Tools & Techniques**<br>
Kafka for Event Replay & Streaming Processing<br>
Kafka Consumer Groups for Parallel Processing<br>
Sliding Window (deque) for Real-Time Moving Averages<br>
Flink / Kafka Streams for Stateful Processing (if needed)<br>

**Ensuring Accuracy and Consistency in Kafka Recalculations**<br>
To ensure accurate and consistent recalculations in Kafka, we use:<br>
**Idempotent Processing** – Prevents duplicate recalculations by enabling Kafka’s idempotent producer and tracking processed events.<br>
**Partitioning by Key** – Ensures all related events (e.g., same stock symbol) are processed in order within the same partition.<br>
**Kafka Streams for Stateful Processing** – Maintains a moving window of past values, ensuring correct calculations without reloading old data.<br>
**Handling Late Events** – Configuring grace periods in Kafka Streams ensures delayed data is still processed correctly.<br>
With these techniques, we eliminate inconsistencies, prevent duplicate corrections, and ensure real-time data integrity even at scale. <br>

**Summary of Approach:**<br>
For recovering and recalculating missing or incorrect events, Kafka was chosen because of its high throughput, event replay capability, and parallel processing. The approach involves:

1)Replaying past events using Kafka’s infinite retention and offset management.<br>
2)Recalculating missing data using Kafka Streams for stateful processing.<br>
3)Ensuring accuracy with idempotent processing, partitioning by key, and exactly-once processing.<br>
4)Publishing corrected results to a new Kafka topic for downstream services.<br>

Kafka allows low-latency, high-scale event processing, making it the best fit for real-time recovery. 

**Trade-offs & Limitations:** <br>
**Infrastructure Management**:Kafka requires manual setup and monitoring, unlike managed services like AWS Kinesis.<br>
**Storage Growth**: Infinite retention can lead to high storage costs if not managed properly.<br>
**Reprocessing Costs**: Replaying millions of events consumes compute resources, requiring efficient consumer scaling.<br>
Despite these trade-offs, Kafka provides greater control, lower cost at scale, and better performance for high-throughput systems.<br>

**How the Approach Would Change with More Tools**
If we had additional tools, we could optimize further:

Databases (PostgreSQL, Snowflake) – Store processed events instead of replaying Kafka offsets for missing data.<br>
S3 + AWS Athena – Store raw logs in S3, allowing SQL-based error detection and targeted reprocessing.<br>
These tools would reduce reliance on event replay and improve efficiency for large-scale processing.<br>

**Scaling to Millions of Events Per Hour**
Kafka is designed for massive scale and can handle millions of events per second with:

More Kafka Partitions – Spreads load across brokers for parallel event ingestion.<br>
Multiple Consumer Groups – Enables different services to process events concurrently.<br>
Kafka Streams for Real-Time Processing – Avoids the need for full event replay by maintaining stateful computations.<br>
Compression & Tiered Storage – Reduces Kafka storage costs while retaining historical event data.<br>

With these optimizations, Kafka can scale seamlessly, ensuring fast and accurate event recovery at any load. <br>
